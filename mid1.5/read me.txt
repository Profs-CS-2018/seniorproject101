In order for universityupload.php and universitydownload.php to work the guideline_uploads folder MUST be placed in the same folder as universityupload.php and universitydownload.php. It will not work otherwise. I'm assuming that all the files  will be placed in the php folder. This ONLY works with PDF files. No other uploads or downloads will be allowed. Additionally, you MUST USE the latest database dump.
